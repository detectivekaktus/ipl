# The Imperative Programming Language contributing guidelines
Here are simple rules:
1. Use 2 spaces for indentation.
2. Don't change the **format** in which was written the code before you. If you have a linter or something that helps you, please be sure to turn it off.
3. Make small changes with each commit, otherwise your pull request will be rejected.
4. Possibly leave comments on something that potentially can be unclear.
